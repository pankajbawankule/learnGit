Version Control – What and Why?
What version control systems does?
It creates the snapshot of our project files means addition, modification and deletion
Version control system:
 

Why version control:
1.	It avails us collaboration. (3 different developers modifying same file and when finally merges then lot of conflicts.)  It issue resolved by VCS.
 
2.	Storing versions  maintaining different versions of project is very important.
3.	Naming to the version.
4.	How to track exact difference between versions.
 
5.	Version control system provides us backup.
 
6.	Analysis of project.
 

Version Control Tools:
1.	Most popular version control tools.
 
Apache subversion (SVN) and CVS  Centralized version control tools. They do not provide local copies and developers have to work directly on central server. These are obsolete tools.
Git and mercurial  they follow distributed architecture. They maintain the common copy on central server and developers work on their local copies.
All above tools are open source.

Survey for user’s interest using different version control tools:
 




Git and Github:

 
Repository: Is a dataspace where we will store all project files.
Github: is a code hosting platform which allows us to keep our central repository on their server.
Git: is a tool create my local repository. It is a version control management tool which allows us multiple operations like push, pull etc.

Advantages of distributed version systems over centralized version control system:
1.	It provide us backup. If central server crashes back will be always available of developer’s local repository.
2.	It provide us speed. To connect to project file we always need to travel on network to connect to central server, whereas in distributed system developers work on local copy, so work can be done speedily even if internet is not available. In distributed VCS we don’t need internet always, we need it when we push or pull to/from server.

Understanding concept through case study:
 
 

What is Git:
Git is a distributed version control tool.
 

Features of Git:
 
1.	Distributed:
 
2.	Compatible:
 
3.	Supports nonlinear development of software:
Through branching  it allows support to non-liner development.
 
4.	Lightweight:
 
5.	Speed:
 
6.	Open source:
 
7.	Reliable:
 
8.	Secure:
 
9.	Economical:
